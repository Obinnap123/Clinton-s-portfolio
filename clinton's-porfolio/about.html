        <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m Paul Clinton Obinna.
        I’m an aspiring web developer with a growing passion for creating responsive and user-friendly websites. Although I’m still in the early stages of my career, I’m dedicated to learning and improving my skills every day. My main focus has been on front-end development, using tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.<br>
        <p>
        Currently, I’m honing my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, working on small projects to expand my knowledge and build a strong foundation for my career. I’m excited about the future and looking forward to contributing to innovative projects.</p>
       
        When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading up on industry trends, and finding inspiration for my next project.<br>
